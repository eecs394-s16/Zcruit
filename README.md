Zcruit - College Football Recruitment Management System
====================================
## DESCRIPTION
Zcruit is a management system for college football recruitment. This app is intended to be used by football team coaches and recruiters. The app is optimized for iPads. 

On this app, you can:
* View and edit profiles of all prospective football players in the database
* Filter players by different criteria (e.g. positions played, location of high school) to find targeted players
* See the prediction of how likely a player will commit to school based on his Zcruit score*
* Easily move a playerâ€™s ranking in his position compared to other recruits by using drag-and-drop
* Add players into customized categories

Note:
*The current Zcruit scores are fake and don't match with the actual algorithm
